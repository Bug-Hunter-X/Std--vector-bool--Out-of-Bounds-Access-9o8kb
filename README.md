This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in C++ involving out-of-bounds access to `std::vector<bool>`.  While standard vectors throw exceptions on out-of-bounds access, `std::vector<bool>` has specialized behavior that can lead to undefined behavior without a clear error message. The example shows how to reproduce the issue and how to use safe practices to avoid it.  Always check your vector indices!
